@article{Canetti2001,
	Abstract = {We propose a novel paradigm for defining security of cryptographic protocols, called universally composable security. The salient property of universally composable definitions of security is that they guarantee security even when a secure protocol is composed of an arbitrary set of protocols, or more generally when the protocol is used as a component of an arbitrary system. This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more. We also make initial steps towards studying the realizability of the proposed definitions in various settings.},

@article{Groth2004,
	Abstract = {In the literature, voting protocols are considered secure if they satisfy requirements such as privacy, accuracy, robustness, etc. It can be time consuming to evaluate a voting protocol with respect to all these requirements and it is not clear that the list of known requirements is complete. Perhaps because of this many papers on electronic voting do not offer any security proof at all.As a solution to this, we suggest, evaluating voting schemes in the universal composability framework. We investigate the popular class of voting schemes based on homomorphic threshold encryption. It turns out that schemes in this class realize an ideal voting functionality that takes the votes as input and outputs the result. This ideal functionality corresponds closely to the well-known ballot box model used today in manual voting. Security properties such as privacy, accuracy and robustness now follow as easy corollaries. We note that some security requirements, for instance incoercibility, are not addressed by our solution.Security holds in the random oracle model against a non-adaptive adversary. We show with a concrete example that the schemes are not secure against adaptive adversaries. We proceed to sketch how to make them secure against adaptive adversaries in the erasure model with virtually no loss of efficiency. We also briefly hint at how to achieve security against adaptive adversaries in the erasure-free model.},

	Abstract = {One of the most fundamental notions of cryptography is that of simulation. It stands behind the concepts of semantic security, zero knowledge, and security for multiparty computation. However, writing a simulator and proving security via the use of simulation is a non-trivial task, and one that many newcomers to the field often find difficult. In this tutorial, we provide a guide to how to write simulators and prove security via the simulation paradigm. Although we have tried to make this tutorial as stand-alone as possible, we assume some familiarity with the notions of secure encryption, zero-knowledge, and secure computation.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new ID-based event-oriented linkable ring signature scheme, with an option as revocable-iff-linked. With this option, if a user generates two linkable ring signatures in the same event, everyone can compute his identity from these two signatures. We are the first in the literature to propose such a secure construction in an ID-based setting. Even compared with other existing non ID-based schemes, we enjoy significant efficiency improvement, including constant signature size and linking complexity. Our scheme can be also regarded as a normal ID-based ring signature. We are also the first to propose such a scheme with constant signature size and enhanced privacy, namely the signer is anonymous even to the PKG who has the master secret key. We prove the security of our scheme in the random oracle model, using DL, DDL and q-SDH assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {We propose an authentication scheme in which users can be authenticated anonymously so long as times that they are authenticated is within an allowable number. The proposed scheme has two features that allow 1) no one, not even an authority, identify users who have been authenticated within the allowable number, and that allow 2) anyone to trace, without help from the authority, dishonest users who have been authenticated beyond the allowable number by using the records of these authentications. Although identity escrow/group signature schemes allow users to be anonymously authenticated, the authorities in these schemes have the unnecessary ability to trace any user. Moreover, since it is only the authority who is able to trace users, one needs to make cumbersome inquiries to the authority to see how many times a user has been authenticated. Our scheme can be applied to e-voting, e-cash, electronic coupons, and trial browsing of content. In these applications, our scheme, unlike the previous one, conceals users' participation from protocols and guarantees that they will remain anonymous to everyone.},

@article{Ibrahim2003,
	Abstract = { With a rapid growth in computer networks, many people can access the network through the Internet and therefore an electronic voting can be a viable alternative for conducting an election. An electronic voting system must attempt to achieve at least the same level of security as ordinary elections. We have developed an electronic voting system, E-voting for a general election. The E-voting system employs cryptographic techniques to overcome the security issues in the election process. In this system, voter's privacy is guaranteed by using a blind signature for confidentiality and voter's digital signature for voter's authentication. E-voting is implemented by employing Java socket technology and BouncyCastle cryptography provider. The provider, which is an open source library, is used to provide the secure communication channel. The voter's private key for digital signature is protected by using password-based encryption with SHA and Twofish-CBC algorithm so that only valid voter can use it.},

@article{Cramer1997,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present a new multi-authority secret-ballot election scheme that guarantees privacy, universal verifiability, and robustness. It is the first scheme for which the performance is optimal in the sense that time and communication complexity is minimal both for the individual voters and the authorities. An interesting property of the scheme is that the time and communication complexity for the voter is independent of the number of authorities. A voter simply posts a single encrypted message accompanied by a compact proof that it contains a valid vote. Our result is complementary to the result by Cramer, Franklin, Schoenmakers, and Yung in the sense that in their scheme the work for voters is linear in the number of authorities but can be instantiated to yield information-theoretic privacy, while in our scheme the voter's effort is independent of the number of authorities but always provides computational privacy-protection. We will also point out that the majority of proposed voting schemes provide computational privacy only (often without even considering the lack of information-theoretic privacy), and that our new scheme is by far superior to those schemes. 1},

@article{Kusters2010,
	Abstract = {Many cryptographic tasks and protocols, such as non-repudiation, contract-signing, voting, auction, identity-based encryption, and certain forms of secure multi-party computation, involve the use of (semi-)trusted parties, such as notaries and authorities. It is crucial that such parties can be held accountable in case they misbehave as this is a strong incentive for such parties to follow the proto- col. Unfortunately, there does not exist a general and convincing definition of accountability that would allow to assess the level of accountability a protocol provides. In this paper, we therefore propose a new, widely applicable def- inition of accountability, with interpretations both in symbolic and computational models. Our definition reveals that accountability is closely related to verifiability, for which we also propose a new definition. We prove that verifiability can be interpreted as a re- stricted form of accountability. Our findings on verifiability are of independent interest. As a proof of concept, we apply our definitions to the analy- sis of protocols for three different tasks: contract-signing, voting, and auctions. Our analysis unveils some subtleties and unexpected weaknesses, showing in one case that the protocol is unusable in practice. However, for this protocol we propose a fix to establish a reasonable level of accountability.},

	Abstract = {The aggregation of conflicting preferences is a key issue in multiagent systems. Due to its universality, voting has a central role among preference aggregationmechanisms. Vot- ing among a set of alternatives can be used for such diverse tasks as choosing a joint plan in a multiagent system, deter- mining a leader in a group of humans or agents, or voting among different resource or task allocations. Maintaining privacy of individuals' votes is crucial in order to guarantee freedom of choice (e.g., lack of vote coercing and reputation effects), and not facilitate strategic voting. We investigate whether unconditional full privacy can be achieved in voting, that is, privacy that relies neither on trusted third parties (or on a certain fraction of the voters being trusted), nor on computational intractability assumptions (such as the hard- ness of factoring). In particular, we study the existence of distributed protocols that allow voters to jointly determine the outcome of an election without revealing any informa- tion but the election outcome. We show the impossibility of reaching unconditional full privacy for a variety of the most common voting schemes ranging from simple veto voting to the single transferable vote scheme. On the positive side, we propose several distributed protocols that privately compute the outcome of common voting schemes while only revealing a limited amount of information.},

	Abstract = {We introduce Scantegrity II, a practical enhancement for optical scan voting systems that achieves increased elec-tion integrity through the novel use of confirmation codes printed on ballots in invisible ink. Voters mark ballots just as in conventional optical scan but using a special pen that develops the invisible ink. Verifiability of elec-tion integrity is end-to-end, allowing voters to check that their votes are correctly included (without revealing their votes) and allowing anyone to check that the tally is com-puted correctly from the included votes. Unlike in the original Scantegrity, dispute resolution neither relies on paper chits nor requires election officials to recover par-ticular ballot forms. Scantegrity II works with either precinct-based or central scan systems. The basic system has been implemented in open-source Java with off-the-shelf printing equipment and has been tested in a small election. An enhancement to Scantegrity II keeps ballot iden-tification and other unique information that is revealed to the voter in the booth from being learned by persons other than the voter. This modification achieves privacy that is essentially equivalent to that of ordinary paper bal-lot systems, allowing manual counting and recounting of ballots.},

	Abstract = {We present a number of enhancements to the voter verifiable election scheme Pr{\^{e}}t {\`{a}}Voter [CRS05]. Firstly, we propose a mechanism for the distributed construction by a set of independent clerks of the ballot forms. This construction leads to proto-ballot forms with the candidate list encrypted and ensures that only a collusion of all the clerks could determine the cryptographic seeds or the onion/candidate list association. This eliminates the need to trust a single authority to keep this information secret. Furthermore, it allows the on-demand decryption and printing of the ballot forms, so eliminating chain of custody issues and the chain voting style attacks against encrypted receipt schemes identified in [RP05]. The ballot forms proposed here use ElGamal randomised encryption so enabling the use of re-encryption mixes for the anonymising tabulation phase in place of the decryption mixes. This has a number of advantages over the RSA decryption mixes used previously: tolerance against failure of any of the mix tellers, full mixing of terms over the Z*{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} space and enabling the mixes and audits to be fully independently rerun if necessary. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

	Abstract = {We present a new paper-based voting method with in-teresting security properties. The attempt here is to see if one can achieve the same security properties of recently proposed cryptographic voting protocols, but without using any cryptography, using only paper bal-lots. We partially succeed. (Initially, I thought the pro-posal accomplished this goal, but several readers discov-ered a vote-buying attack (see Section 4.4) that appears to be rather difficult to fix without making the result-ing system much less usable in practice. Currently, this paper should thus be viewed more as an academic pro-posal than a practical proposal. Perhaps some variation on these ideas in this paper might still turn out to be of practical use. The " OneBallot with Exchanged Re-ceipts " system sketched at the end of Section 5.3.1, looks particularly promising at the moment. . .) The principles of ThreeBallot are simple and easy to understand. In this proposal, not only can each voter verify that her vote is recorded as she intended, but she gets a " re-ceipt " that she can take home that can be used later to verify that her vote is actually included in the final tally. Her receipt, however, does not allow her to prove to anyone else how she voted. In this " ThreeBallot " voting system, each voter casts three paper ballots, with certain restrictions on how they may be filled out, so the tallying works. These paper ballots are of course " voter-verifiable. " All ballots cast are scanned and published on a web site, so anyone may correctly compute the election result. A voter receives a copy of one of her ballots as her " receipt " , which she may take home. Only the voter knows which ballot she copied for her receipt. The voter is unable to use her receipt to prove how she voted or to sell her vote, as the receipt doesn't reveal how she voted.},

Intuitively, an election protocol is coercion-resistant if a voter A cannot prove to a potential coercer C that she voted in a particular way. We assume that A cooperates with C in an interactive fashion. Receipt-freeness is a weaker property, for which we assume that A and C cannot interact during the protocol: to break receipt-freeness, A later provides evidence (the receipt) of how she voted. While receipt-freeness can be expressed using observational equivalence from the applied pi calculus, we need to introduce a new relation to capture coercion-resistance. Our formalization of coercion-resistance and receipt-freeness are quite different. Nevertheless, we show in accordance with intuition that coercion-resistance implies receipt-freeness, which implies privacy, the basic anonymity property of voting protocols, as defined in previous work. Finally we illustrate the definitions on a simplified version of the Lee et al. voting protocol},

This may be somewhat surprising, since in the folklore the properties of having forgery being equivalent to factoring and being invulnerable to an adaptive chosen-message attack were considered to be contradictory.More generally, we show how to construct a signature scheme with such properties based on the existence of a ``claw-free'' pair of permutations---a potentially weaker assumption than the intractibility of integer factorization.The new scheme is potentially practical: signing and verifying signatures are reasonably fast, and signatures are compact.},

We also give efficient zero-knowledge protocols$\backslash$nfor proving knowledge of the contents of commitments and for verifying$\backslash$nmultiplicative relations over the integers on committed values. The$\backslash$nscheme can be seen as a generalization, with a slight modification,$\backslash$nof the earlier scheme of Fujisaki and Okamoto [14]. The reasons we$\backslash$nrevisit the earlier scheme and give some modification to it are as$\backslash$nfollows: The earlier scheme [14] has some gaps in the proof of soundness$\backslash$nof the associated protocols, one of which presents a non-trivial$\backslash$nproblem which, to the best of our knowledge, has remained open until$\backslash$nnow. We fill all the gaps here using additional ideas including minor$\backslash$nmodification of the form of a commitment. Although related works$\backslash$nsuch as [8, 3, 10, 4] do not suffer from the main problem we solve$\backslash$nhere, the reason for this is that they use "commitments" with a single$\backslash$nbase (i.e., of form c=g{\^{}}s $\backslash$bmod n). Such commitments, however,$\backslash$ncannot satisfy the standard hiding property for commitments, and$\backslash$nhence protocols using them cannot in general be (honest-verifier)$\backslash$nzero-knowledge nor witness indistinguishable. In a computationally$\backslash$nconvincing proof of knowledge where the prover produces the common$\backslash$ninput (which is the type of protocol we look at here), one cannot$\backslash$ncompletely exclude the possibility that a prover manages to produce$\backslash$na common input on which he can cheat easily. This means that the$\backslash$nstandard definition of proofs of knowledge cannot be satisfied. Therefore$\backslash$nwe introduce a new definition for computationally convincing proofs$\backslash$nof knowledge, designed to handle the case where the common input$\backslash$nis chosen by the (possibly cheating) prov er. Our results apply to$\backslash$nany group with suitable properties. In particular, they apply to$\backslash$na much larger class of RSA moduli than the safe prime products proposed$\backslash$nin [14] - Potential examples include RSA moduli, class groups and,$\backslash$nwith a slight modification, even non-Abelian groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOur scheme can replace the earlier one in various other constructions,$\backslash$nsuch as the efficient interval proofs of Boudot [4] and the efficient$\backslash$nproofs for the product of two safe primes proposed by Camenisch and$\backslash$nMichels [9].},

	Abstract = {We present the cryptographic implementation of ``DEMOS'', a new e-voting system that is end-to-end verifiable in the standard model, i.e., without any additional ``setup'' assumption or access to a random oracle (RO). Previously known end-to-end verifiable e-voting systems required such additional assumptions (specifically, either the existence of a ``randomness beacon'' or were only shown secure in the RO model). In order to analyze our scheme, we also provide a modeling of end-toend verifiability as well as privacy and receipt-freeness that encompasses previous definitions in the form of two concise attack games. Our scheme satisfies end-to-end verifiability information theoretically in the standard model and privacy/receipt-freeness under a computational assumption (subexponential Decisional Diffie Helman). In our construction, we utilize a number of techniques used for the first time in the context of e-voting schemes that include utilizing randomness from bitfixing sources, zero-knowledge proofs with imperfect verifier randomness and complexity leveraging. {\textcopyright} International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.},

	Abstract = {A shuffle consists of a permutation and re-encryption of a set of input ciphertexts. One application of shuffles is to build mix-nets. We suggest an honest verifier zero-knowledge argument for the correctness of a shuffle of homomorphic encryptions.Our scheme is more efficient than previous schemes both in terms of communication and computation. The honest verifier zero-knowledge argument has a size that is independent of the actual cryptosystem being used and will typically be smaller than the size of the shuffle itself. Moreover, our scheme is well suited for the use of multi-exponentiation and batch-verification techniques.Additionally, we suggest a more efficient honest verifier zero-knowledge argument for a commitment containing a permutation of a set of publicly known messages. We also suggest an honest verifier zero-knowledge argument for the correctness of a combined shuffle-and-decrypt operation that can be used in connection with decrypting mix-nets based on ElGamal encryption.All our honest verifier zero-knowledge arguments can be turned into honest verifier zero-knowledge proofs. We use homomorphic commitments as an essential part of our schemes. When the commitment scheme is statistically hiding we obtain statistical honest verifier zero-knowledge arguments; when the commitment scheme is statistically binding, we obtain computational honest verifier zero-knowledge proofs.},

	Abstract = {In voting based on homomorphic threshold encryption, the voter en- crypts his vote and sends it in to the authorities that tally the votes. If voters can send in arbitrary plaintexts then they can cheat. It is therefore important that they attach an argument of knowledge of the plaintext being a correctly formed vote. Typically, these arguments are honest verifier zero-knowledge arguments that are made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Security is argued in the random oracle model. The simplest case iswhere each voter has a single vote to cast. Practical solutions have already been suggested for the single vote case. However, as we shall see homomorphic threshold encryption can be used for a variety of elections, in par- ticular there are many cases where voters can castmultiple votes at once. In these cases, it remains important to bring down the cost of the NIZK argument. We improve on state of the art in the case of limited votes, where each voter can vote a small number of times. We also improve on the state of the art in shareholder elections, where each voter may have a large number of votes to spend. Moreover, we improve on the state of the art in Borda voting. Finally, we suggest a NIZK argument for correctness of an approval vote. To the best of our knowledge, approval voting has not been considered before in the cryptographic literature.},

@article{Kiayias2015,
	Abstract = {Recently, Kiayias, Zacharias and Zhang proposed a new E2E verifiable e-voting system called 'DEMOS' that for the first time provides E2E verifiability without relying on external sources of randomness or the random oracle model; the main advantage of such system is in the fact that election auditors need only the election transcript and the feedback from the voters to pronounce the election process unequivocally valid. Unfortunately, DEMOS comes with a huge performance and storage penalty for the election authority (EA) compared to other e-voting systems such as Helios. The main reason is that due to the way the EA forms the proof of the tally result, it is required to precompute a number of ciphertexts for each voter and each possible choice of the voter. This approach clearly does not scale to elections that have a complex ballot and voters have an exponential number of ways to vote in the number of candidates. The performance penalty on the EA appears to be intrinsic to the approach: voters cannot compute an enciphered ballot themselves because there seems to be no way for them to prove that it is a valid ciphertext. In contrast to the above, in this work, we construct a new e-voting system that retains the strong E2E characteristics of DEMOS (but against computational adversaries) while completely eliminating the performance and storage penalty of the EA. We achieve this via a new cryptographic construction that has the EA produce and prove, using voters' coins, the security of a common reference string (CRS) that voters subsequently can use to afix non-interactive zeroknowledge (NIZK) proofs to their ciphertexts. The EA itself uses the CRS to prove via a NIZK the tally correctness at the end. Our construction has similar performance to Helios and is practical. The privacy of our construction relies on the SXDH assumption over bilinear groups via complexity leveraging. {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

@article{Bernhard2011,
	Abstract = {Recent results show that the current implementation of Helios, a practical e-voting protocol, does not ensure independence of the cast votes, and demonstrate the impact of this lack of independence on vote privacy. Some simple fixes seem to be available and security of the revised scheme has been studied with respect to symbolic models. In this paper we study the security of Helios using computational models. Our first contribution is a model for the property known as ballot privacy that generalizes and extends several existing ones. Using this model, we investigate an abstract voting scheme (of which the revised Helios is an instantiation) built from an arbitrary encryption scheme with certain functional properties. We prove, generically, that whenever this encryption scheme falls in the class of voting-friendly schemes that we define, the resulting voting scheme provably satisfies ballot privacy. We explain how our general result yields cryptographic security guarantees for the revised version of Helios (albeit from non-standard assumptions). Furthermore, we show (by giving two distinct constructions) that it is possible to construct voting-friendly encryption, and therefore voting schemes, using only standard cryptographic tools. We detail an instantiation based on ElGamal encryption and Fiat-Shamir non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that closely resembles Helios and which provably satisfies ballot privacy.},
